EBS Output Post Processor Troubleshooting
=========================================

The OPP process only run on the concurrent manager nodes
Login to each CM nodes
cd $APPLCSF/$APPLLOG
ls -ltr FNDOPP*

This will show the log files from the OPP, check for any errors like OOM

Terminate the OPP processes from EBS Concurrent Manager Form:-
Concurrent -> Manager -> Adminsiter
Select the manager to be terminated and click on the Terminate button
(I have found the Restart option not to be very reliable)

Then kill off from the backend on CM nodes

ps -ef |grep FNDOPP | grep -v grep

kill -9 PID

Once the processes are terminated go back to Concurrent Manager form and Activate the OPP:-
Concurrent -> Manager -> Adminsiter
Select the manager to be started and click on the Activate button
